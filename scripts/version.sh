# `bump` sets it to the next version after the newest tag: a minor version
# when the API moved (before v1 a minor version may change the resources
# incompatibly, as the preview APIs may), a patch otherwise. A version that
# is already newer than that, a bump not released yet, stays. The
# regeneration workflow bumps it in its pull request, and tag.yml tags it
# once that is merged.
